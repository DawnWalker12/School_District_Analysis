# Challenge - School_District_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to find the overall passing percentages of the students and see if there is any correlation with the budget per student. I found some scores were missing. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove all the NANs from the dataset. Therefore my data is "dirty".

# Results

## * How is the district summary affected?
     Since I have "dirty data", I am not sure. My District Summary dataframe is pictured below.

# Conclusion
